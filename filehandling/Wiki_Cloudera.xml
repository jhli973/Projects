'''Cloudera Inc.''' is an American-based software company that provides [[Apache Hadoop]]-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.

Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, [[Apache HBase]], and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html|title=Apache Software Foundation Sponsorship|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Three engineers from [[Google]], [[Yahoo]] and [[Facebook Inc.|Facebook]] ([[Christophe Bisciglia]], [[Amr Awadallah]] and [[Jeff Hammerbacher]], respectively) joined with a former [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] executive ([[Michael Olson|Mike Olson]]) to form Cloudera in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/bottling-the-magic-behind-google-and-facebook/ |title= Bottling the Magic Behind Google an Facebook |last= Vance |first= Ashlee |date= 16 March 2009 |accessdate= 20 January 2014 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Olson was the CEO of [[Sleepycat Software]], the creator of the open-source embedded database engine [[Berkeley DB]] (acquired by Oracle in 2006). 
Awadallah was from [[Yahoo!|Yahoo]], where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-01-31/news/31008410_1_yahoo-servers-and-storage-systems-oracle |title=This Former Yahoo-er's Startup Is So Hot, Even the CIA Invested In It |accessdate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120209182001/http://articles.businessinsider.com:80/2012-01-31/news/31008410_1_yahoo-servers-and-storage-systems-oracle |archivedate=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_17/b4225060960537.htm|title=This Tech Bubble Is Different|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect [[Doug Cutting]], also a former chairman of the [[Apache Software Foundation]], authored the open-source [[Lucene]] and [[Nutch]] search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009.
Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at [[ArcSight]] when it was acquired by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Cloudera taps new CEO for inevitable IPO push or acquisition: Former CEO becomes chairman and chief strategist |author= Timothy Prickett Morgan |work= The Register |date= 20 June 2013 |url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/06/20/cloudera_taps_new_ceo_for_inevitable_ipo_push_or_acquisition/ |accessdate= 20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for that Intel received 18% share in cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on cloudera projects.
